# Own-Neural-Network-For-Dog-Cat-Classifier

# Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) 
CNNs are deep learning models suited for analyzing visual imagery. They are heavily influenced by how we - humans, see the surrounding world. Before we proceed to CNNs in order to analyze how computers see, letâ€™s focus on how humans are able to do it.

# Activation
we will use ReLU activation function that returns 0 for every negative value in the input image while it returns the same value for every positive value.
# Pooling
the system will be capable of recognizing an object as an object even when its appearance varies in some way.
# Fully Connected
 we flatten the output of the last convolution layer and connect every node of the current layer with the other node of the next layer. 
# Image Classification - is it a cat or a dog?
The ultimate goal of this project is to create a system that can detect cats and dogs. While our goal is very specific (cats vs dogs), ImageClassifier can detect anything that is tangible with an adequate dataset.
