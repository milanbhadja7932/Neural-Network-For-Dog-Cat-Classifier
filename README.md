# Own-Neural-Network-For-Dog-Cat-Classifier

# Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) 
CNNs are deep learning models suited for analyzing visual imagery. They are heavily influenced by how we - humans, see the surrounding world. Before we proceed to CNNs in order to analyze how computers see, letâ€™s focus on how humans are able to do it.

# Image Classification - is it a cat or a dog?
The ultimate goal of this project is to create a system that can detect cats and dogs. While our goal is very specific (cats vs dogs), ImageClassifier can detect anything that is tangible with an adequate dataset.
